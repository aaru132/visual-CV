# visual-CV
A Visual CV (or visual résumé) is a modern, design-focused version of a traditional résumé that combines professional information with attractive visuals, graphics, and layout elements. It presents key achievements and experiences through infographics, icons, and timelines, making the document more engaging and easier to read. Typically created using tools like Canva, Adobe Express, or Visme, a visual CV emphasizes personal branding and creativity. It often includes color-coded sections for education, skills, and experience, along with a profile photo and a concise personal statement at the top. Skills are commonly displayed using visual indicators like bars or star ratings, allowing quick recognition of strengths. This format works best for creative fields such as design, marketing, and media, where presentation matters. While the design is important, a visual CV should still remain clear, professional, and ATS-friendly when submitted digitally.
